  - Toggle between light and dark themes
  - Preference stored in browser localStorage

- **Server-Side Rendering with Thymeleaf**
  - Dynamic item/member views, forms, and error handling

## üõ†Tech Stack

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring MVC** (Spring Boot)
- **Thymeleaf** (server-side rendering)
- **Maven** (build tool)
- **PostgreSQL** (manual setup)
- **HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript** (frontend)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven
- PostgreSQL

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Database Setup

Manually create a PostgreSQL database and user, for example:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE library_db;
CREATE USER library_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE library_db TO library_user;
```

Add/update the following properties in your `application.properties`:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/library_db
spring.datasource.username=library_user
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

### Running the Application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- `DELETE /books/{id}` ‚Äî Delete book
- `PATCH /books/{id}/assign` ‚Äî Assign to member
- `PATCH /books/{id}/release` ‚Äî Release to library

### Movies & Journals

### Members

- `GET /members` ‚Äî List all members
- `GET /members/{id}` ‚Äî Member details (with checked-out items)
