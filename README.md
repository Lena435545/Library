This is a Spring MVC + Thymeleaf web application for managing a library of books, movies, and journals.
It allows creating, editing, deleting, and assigning library items to registered members.

The application also supports a dark/light theme toggle, CRUD operations for different types of library items, and a check-out/check-in system for managing which member currently holds an item.
